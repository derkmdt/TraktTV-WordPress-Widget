== Changelog ==

= 1.2 = 

* Caching results from API - huge performance boost
* Because of simple caching, only one copy of widget will work. Please hold with update until the new release, if you plan to use more than one widget on your blog.
* Some plugin filesystem cleaning and other technical stuff you shouldn't notice
* Simple style override - just create file named user-trakttv.css in your theme directory

= 1.1a =

* Fixed episode info for actions other than "seen"

= 1.1 = 

Added few options:
* select max last views
* select types (movies, shows, episodes)
* select actions (watching, scrobble, rated, etc.)

Some code cleanup

= 1.0 =

* First stable version. Hardcoded 10 last views. Only one widget type.
